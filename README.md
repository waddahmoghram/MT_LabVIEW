# Overview
This LabVIEW Real-time module project contains the updated master Visual Instruments (VIs) to operate a magnetic-flux feedback controlled Magnetic Tweezer (MT) described in two companion publications (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0039696) and (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0041262). In this work, we presented a single pole magnetic tweezers (MT) device designed for integration with substrate deformation tracking microscopy (DTM) and/or traction force microscopy (TFM) experiments intended to explore extracellular matrix rheology and human epidermal keratinocyte mechanobiology. Assembled from commercially available off-the-shelf electronics hardware and software, the MT device is amenable to replication in the basic biology laboratory. In contrast to conventional solenoid current controlled MT devices, operation of this instrument is based on real time feedback control of the magnetic flux density emanating from the blunt end of the needle core using a cascade control scheme and a digital proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Algorithms that compensate for an apparent spatially non-uniform remnant magnetization of the needle core that develops during actuation are implemented into the feedback control scheme. Through optimization of PID gain scheduling, the MT device exhibits magnetization and demagnetization response times of less than 100 ms without overshoot over a wide range of magnetic flux density setpoints. Compared to current based control, magnetic flux density-based control allows for more accurate and precise magnetic actuation forces by compensating for temperature increases within the needle core due to heat generated by the applied solenoid currents. Near field calibrations validate the ability of the MT device to actuate 4.5 µm diameter superparamagnetic beads with forces up to 25 nN with maximum relative uncertainties of ±30% for beads positioned between 2.5 and 40 µm from the needle tip.
